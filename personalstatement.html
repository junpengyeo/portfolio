              <p><b>Internship Objectives:</b> As a technical designer and someone who strongly believes in life-long learning, I hope to continue to develop my design and technical skills with the startup I intern with, while making meaningful contributions. Additionally, I wish to learn from my peers, to gain fresh and creative insights that will guide me in my journey to becoming a future entrepreneur. I also hope to forge long-lasting relations with the members of the startup, learning and growing alongside them and the company.</p>

              <p><b>About Me:</b> I aspire to be an entrepreneur; to leverage on the power of entrepreneurship in creating tangible change. Having grown and been exposed to this ever-changing industry, I have developed a strong passion for the many possibilities and opportunities that it presents, allowing me to work toward my goals in creating value for the world.</p>
              
              <p>Driven by my entrepreneurial aspirations, I founded my first startup, routex, at 18 years old. The mission behind the start-up was aimed at providing fair wages to freelance service providers across Indonesia. Since then, I have gained many invaluable lessons from customer relations, to marketing and finances. In addition, I also had the amazing opportunity to attend Y combinator&rsquo;s Start-Up School, where I connected with international founders and Y combinator&rsquo;s network of alumni.</p>
              
              <p>These experiences have not only reinforced my desire to be part of the startup ecosystem but have also pushed me to better myself as an entrepreneur.</p>
              
              <p><b>Work Experience:</b> I have relevant work experience in the startup space. As a result, I have a strong understanding that job scopes in a startup can sometimes be fluid and that we have to be quick to adapt, and to pick up new skills as and when it is needed.</p>
              
              <p><b>Unique Skill Sets:</b> My experience working in two different startups has enabled me to pick up a myriad of skills over the years outside of school such as coding and marketing. As a result, I have an all-rounded understanding of things as well as a diverse skill set. With both creative and technical skills and knowledge, I can perceive things from many different points of views, allowing me to bring meaningful and interesting insights to the table.</p>
              
              <p>As a designer, I have a good grasp of ideation, user interface/user experience (UI/UX) and service design. My exposure to service design has given me the opportunity to develop products from the research phase to testing prototypes. Through my design experiences, I have also developed an affinity for seeing problems as opportunities.</p>
              
              <p>Being a designer with interest and experience in coding, it allows me to appreciate and understand the technical limitations of many products and services. This knowledge has proved to be useful when generating solutions, as I am able to strategically balance between both front and backends of a problem. My design sensitivity, coupled with my marketing experience also enables me to deliver relevant and engaging content to the right audience, as well as create and design more meaningful and purposeful solutions for the end-user. </p>
